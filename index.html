		 	   Located in Bangalore, in a beautifully renovated health and wellness facility, Dance Lyfe offers dance classes that range from pre-school to young-adult in a family-friendly, safe and supportive environment.  We believe our first responsibility is to treat our students, their families, our teachers and neighbors with the upmost respect.  We constantly strive to provide a premiere dance education worthy of our outstanding community reputation.  We teach dance, but also look to build up coordination, fitness, sense of rhythm, musicality and self-expression skills as well as beneficial life skills such as commitment and teamwork. Our dancers make long lasting friendships and memories, and we love providing that space.
